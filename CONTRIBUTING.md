# Contributing

Thanks for (thinking about) contributing to Gekko, all help is wanted!

How to start all depends on what you'd like to do:

- If you want to add an exchange to Gekko, see [this doc](https://github.com/askmike/gekko/blob/develop/docs/internals/exchanges.md) for all the information you need.
- If you want to Gekko react to anything from the market, you can most likely put this functionality into a plugin. See [this document](https://github.com/askmike/gekko/blob/develop/docs/internals/plugins.md) for details.
- If you want to add trading strategies / indicators, please see [this document](https://github.com/askmike/gekko/blob/develop/docs/trading_bot/creating_a_trading_method.md).
- If you just want to work on Gekko, you can use the open issues with the tag `open-for-pulls` for inspiration.
- If you want to work on the web interface (Gekko UI), please see [this frontend doc](https://github.com/askmike/gekko/blob/develop/docs/gekko_ui/frontend.md) on the Vue.js frontend.

Things to take into consideration when submitting a pull request:

 - Please submit all pull requests (except for hotfixes) to the [develop branch](https://github.com/askmike/gekko/tree/develop).
 - Please keep current code styling in mind.
